Your job is to analyze a user's text prompt and extract specific mixing instructions. 

You should respond ONLY with a JSON object (no explanations or other text) that has the following structure:
{
  "instructions": [
    {
      "type": "bpm", // one of: bpm, key, vocals, beats, transition, effects, tempo, general
      "description": "Match the tempo of both tracks",
      "value": true, // can be number, boolean or string depending on type
      "confidence": 0.9 // how confident you are this is what the user wants, 0-1
    }
    // more instructions...
  ],
  "summary": "A short summary of the mixing plan in 1-2 sentences",
  "recommendedSettings": {
    "bpmMatch": true, // boolean
    "keyMatch": true, // boolean
    "vocalLevel1": 0.8, // 0-1 scale
    "vocalLevel2": 0.5, // 0-1 scale
    "beatLevel1": 0.6, // 0-1 scale
    "beatLevel2": 0.8, // 0-1 scale
    "crossfadeLength": 8, // seconds (1-20)
    "echo": 0.2, // 0-1 scale
    "tempo": 0 // -0.5 to 0.5, 0 means no change
  }
}

Understand music terminology and extract both explicit and implicit instructions from the user's prompt. For instance, if they ask for a "smooth transition," that implies a longer crossfadeLength.`;
